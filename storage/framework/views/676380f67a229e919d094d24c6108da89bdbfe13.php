            <h4>23. Arbitration Agreement</h4>
            <p>Please read this Section (“Arbitration Agreement”) carefully. It is part of your contract with My Mobile DNA LLC and affects your rights. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver. </p>

            <h5>22.2  Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. </h5>
            <p>All claims and disputes in connection with the Terms of Use or the use of the Website or services provided by My Mobile DNA LLC that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and My Mobile DNA LLC, and to any Collectors, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of the Website or services provided under the Terms of Use</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Arbitration Rules. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this dispute resolution provision. Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to, the method of initiating or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”). The Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than ten thousand U.S. Dollars (USD $10,000.00) may be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is ten thousand U.S. Dollars (USD $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing shall be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing shall be held in a location within one hundred (100) miles of your residence, unless you reside outside of the United States, in which case hearing shall be held in the capital of your country, or the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration. If non-appearance arbitration is elected as provided above, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner to be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and My Mobile DNA LLC, and the dispute shall not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and the Terms of Use. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and My Mobile DNA LLC.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Waiver of Jury Trial. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and My Mobile DNA LLC in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND MY MOBILE DNA LLC WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. In the event that this subparagraph is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you or My Mobile DNA LLC is entitled to arbitration and instead claims and disputes shall be resolved in a court located in Phoenix, Arizona. </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>24. Limitation on Time to File Claims</h4>
            <p>ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE WEBSITE MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
            <h4>25. Waiver and Severability</h4>
            <p>No waiver of by the Company of any term or condition set forth in these Terms of Use shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms of Use is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use will continue in full force and effect.</p>
            <h4>26. Entire Agreement</h4>
